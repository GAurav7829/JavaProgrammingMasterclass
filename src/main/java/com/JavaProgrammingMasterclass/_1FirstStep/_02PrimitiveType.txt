Wrapper Class
    Java use the concept of wrapper class for all 8 primitive types.
    In case of int, we can use Integer.
        by doing that it gives us a way to perform operations on an int datatype.
Overflow and Underflow
    if you try to put value larger than MAX value, you will get Overflow,
    if you try to put value smaller than MIN value, you will get Underflow
Size of primitive types and width
    byte occupies 8 bits. Byte has width of 8.
    short occupies 16 bits and has width of 16.
    int occupies 32 bits and has width of 32.

    each primitive type occupies a different amount of memory
